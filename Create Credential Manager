## Here we are defining new credentail that we can use across any other script/anywhere in PowerShell globally

#In order to use Credential Manager, first you need to install in PowerShell
Install-Module -Name CredentialManager

$User = "Suman.kumar@mycompany.com"
$PlainPassword = 'MyPwd'
$SecurePassword = $PlainPassword | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $User, $SecurePassword

##Create New Credential as MyGlobalCredential
New-StoredCredential -Comment 'MyGlobalCredential' -Credentials $cred -Target 'MyGlobalCredential'

## For viewing and consuming stored credential, we can use
$myCred = Get-StoredCredential -Target 'MyGlobalCredential'

#Now Consuming credential across other script,
Connect-AzureAD -Credential $myCred
